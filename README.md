📋 Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get a local copy up and running.

Prerequisites
Node.js (v18 or later)

npm

A Google Generative AI API Key (get one from Google AI Studio)

Installation & Setup
Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/Amit-Dev03/ai-code-reviewer.git](https://github.com/Amit-Dev03/ai-code-reviewer.git)
cd ai-code-reviewer

Setup the Backend:

Navigate to the BackEnd directory: cd BackEnd

Install dependencies: npm install

Create a .env file in the BackEnd root and add your API key:

GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here

Start the server: npm run dev

The backend will be running on http://localhost:3000.

Setup the Frontend:

Navigate to the FrontEnd directory: cd ../FrontEnd

Install dependencies: npm install

Start the client: npm run dev

Open your browser and go to the URL provided (usually http://localhost:5173).

⚙️ How It Works
The user writes or pastes code into the editor on the left panel. Upon clicking "Review Code," the frontend sends the code snippet to the backend Express server via an API call. The backend then forwards this code, along with a detailed system prompt, to the Google Generative AI API. The AI analyzes the code and returns a comprehensive review in Markdown format, which is then rendered on the right panel for the user to see.
